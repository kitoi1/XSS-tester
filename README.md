Overview

Kasau XSS Advanced Tester is a professional-grade tool designed for authorized penetration testing to identify Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. The tool combines advanced payload testing with smart context detection to provide comprehensive security assessments.
Key Features

    Context-Aware Testing: Detects HTML, JavaScript, and attribute contexts to deliver precise payloads

    Multi-Threaded Scanning: Accelerates testing with parallel request processing

    Comprehensive Reporting: Generates detailed vulnerability reports with proof-of-concept examples

    Custom Payload Support: Extend with your own payload library

    Dual Interface: Choose between GUI (Graphical User Interface) or CLI (Command Line Interface)

    Smart Reflection Detection: Identifies subtle reflection patterns that might indicate vulnerabilities

    Bypass Technique Testing: Includes advanced payloads to bypass common WAFs and filters

Step-by-Step Workflow

    Target Specification:

        Provide URL with parameters to test

        Specify HTTP method (GET/POST/PUT)

        Add custom headers if needed

    Scan Configuration:

        Select scan depth (quick/deep/comprehensive)

        Choose payload sets (basic/advanced/WAF-bypass)

        Set thread count for parallel testing

    Scan Execution:

        Tool injects payloads and analyzes responses

        Progress is displayed in real-time

        Suspected vulnerabilities are flagged immediately

    Results Analysis:

        Review detected vulnerabilities

        Examine payload reflection points

        Verify exploitability with proof-of-concept

    Reporting:

        Generate HTML/PDF/JSON reports

        Export curl commands for verification

        Create remediation recommendations

Payload Types Tested

The tool tests multiple XSS variants including:

    Reflected XSS

    Stored XSS

    DOM-based XSS

    Blind XSS

    Polyglot payloads

    WAF bypass techniques

    Template injection tests

Sample Output

[+] Scanning: https://example.com/search?q=test
[!] Potential XSS found in parameter 'q':
    Payload: <svg/onload=alert(1)>
    Context: HTML attribute
    Reflection: <input value="<svg/onload=alert(1)>">
[+] Scan completed: 3 vulnerabilities found

Reporting Features

The tool generates comprehensive reports including:

    Vulnerability details

    Risk ratings

    Affected parameters

    Proof-of-concept code

    Curl commands for verification

    Remediation recommendations

Advanced Configuration

Create a config.ini file to customize:

    Payload sets

    Request timeouts

    Proxy settings

    Custom headers

    Scan depth parameters

    Output formats

Best Practices

    Authorization: Always obtain proper authorization before scanning

    Rate Limiting: Use --delay option to avoid overwhelming servers

    Target Selection: Start with non-production environments

    Verification: Manually verify all reported vulnerabilities

    Reporting: Include context in reports about where/how vulnerabilities were found
